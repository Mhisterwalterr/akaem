    <h2>football</h2>
    <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team’s goal without using their hands or arms.The team that scores more goals wins.football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.
 Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century.
             Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to
              local customs and with a minimum of rules.</p> <p>Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced 
                the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal 
                prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. 
                Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. 
                The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, 
                whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs</p><p>In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball.
                     Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). 
            Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</p>

        The Birthplace of Basketball
        Basketball is built into the fabric of Springfield College. The game was invented by Springfield College instructor and graduate student James Naismith in 1891, and has grown into the worldwide athletic phenomenon we know it to be today.</p>
        <p>The story of how Naismith invented the game through a charge by Luther Gulick (then the College's physical education superintendent) to come up with a new indoor activity that could be played by college students during the long New England winters is well known. What isn't often told is that he created the game in our Springfield College Humanics philosophy - educating students in spirit, mind, and body for leadership in service to others.</p>

    <h2>Long Tennis</h2>
    <p>
        Long tennis is an old word used to describe the differences in the type of court surface used when the modern game of tennis was developing. It was primarily used to distinguish between lawn tennis, which was played on grass, and other types of tennis played on different surfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, sports change. In some games, the change happens very fast. The NFL and NBA of today look very different from the games 10 or 20 years ago. Imagine how much a game that’s as old tennis has changed over the centuries it has been played.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of these main developments in tennis had to do with where participants played the game, and there were specific terms used to distinguish them that might not be as familiar now.

        Boxing (also known as "Western boxing" or "pugilism") is a combat sport in which two people, usually wearing protective gloves and other protective equipment such as hand wraps and mouthguards, throw punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time in a boxing ring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the term "boxing" is commonly attributed to "western boxing", in which only the fists are involved, boxing has developed in various ways in different geographical areas and cultures. In global terms, boxing is a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of the forms of the modern sport are western boxing, bare knuckle boxing, kickboxing, muay-thai, lethwei, savate, and sanda.[1][2] Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.
